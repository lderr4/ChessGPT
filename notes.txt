Game analysis:
thedrunkpigeon vs ncforever
Opening:
	queens gambit declined, pyramid pawn structure for black. very solid
	out of the opening, my position is clearly better. I have two pawns in the center. his biship cramped and his pieces have less mobility
	
	
Middlegame:
	The middlegame begins with a key moment when he pushes to c5 with his pawn. If I push my pawn , I gain complete control of the center, but lose the pawn in the center. 
	I took his pawn and it was a complete mistake.

	I missed a tactic: I needed to see that if I pushed my e pawn, his knight would go to he middle. Then, I could do a discover attack while taking the knight in the middle.


Endgame:
	There was a mass trade of pieces.
	Then I activated my queen. I had the opportunity to check his king and create a bit of an advantage. I should have calculated this further.

	Completely winning. Then make one fatal error and lose. I saw that he was way ahead on time and started panicking a bit
